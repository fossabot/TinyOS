# 🧀TinyOS
A tiny OS running on BOCHS

# 🍉Require
1. Bochs (You can install it via `sudo apt install bochs` or [see it on my blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/6b3df43932c3))
2. Qemu. It is a powerful simulator.  (Get it via `sudo apt install qemu`)

# 🍓Run
```
//RUN IT
make run-qemu

//Clean workspace
make clean
```

# 🍊PS:
Making something is but a lifestyle.
It looks like a bootloader or diskloader rather than an OS. 
Who knows. 🙂
